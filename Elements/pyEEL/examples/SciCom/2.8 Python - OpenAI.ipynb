      "As we embark on ACM SIGGRAPH 2023, let us explore the limitless possibilities of computational medical extended reality. Through this fusion of technology and healthcare, we can revolutionize patient care, training, and surgical procedures. Picture a world where surgeons operate with enhanced precision, medical education evolves to immersive experiences, and patients find solace in virtual rehabilitation. Let us embrace this vision and unlock new avenues of healing through the convergence of computation and medicine. Together, we can redefine the boundaries of healthcare and shape a future where extended reality paves the way for transformative medical innovations.\n"
